					"description": "Madonna, as we all know her as Miss M, she is the ultimate Queen of pop. Working with miss M is an experience no one will never forget, meticulous, detail oriented, artist and style connoisseur and never compromising to get the best of what is possible. I remembered doing sketches at her upper west side home … discussing and drawing scenes as we create the ageless images - soft with such fluid flow. Miss M is a an artist and she knows exactly what works and watching her on set is nothing short of watching a true star performing effortlessly.\n\nThis premiere launch issue of Jack number one is a tribute and homage to a true legend - Madonna. This is where it all begins … we LOVE you miss M!!",

I remembered how amazing when i first met these duo, a true creative force with such great looks and talent, Mike on vocals and writing the songs and Tom making and producing the sound that is electrifying and sexy music to the ears. Mike continues to “ wow “ us with his lyrics and writing, and such presence and haunting voice … Tom continues to give us his hypnotic sound with Vanity Police. They are the ones to watch, they are the new breed.",
